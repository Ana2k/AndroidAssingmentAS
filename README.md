(Possible Template for nested json api parsing)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOME DETAILS

TOY APP to be used as a template for nested JSON Api calling.(WARNING NO VIEMODEL HERE)

* MVVM--> Partially implemented. Not used View Model in this one.

* UI is a pretty neat template for our use (^_^).

* Only the navgraph_json(later merged in main) branch for this works fully.
Fragment Transaction is outdated--buggy--does not run. 
Due to better creation pattern of android navigation -- using jetpack navigation (navgraph). I have not updated that branch.

* Main App using navgraph uses mostly latest architecture and builds dated...25th Oct'21

<!-- * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdX5NJ_sYd12ZtVg7tUQQ2O5JW7BJWdp5bSEZHcqVWU/edit -- some info regarding Json Extractor App and its moving ahead. -->

- [ ] APP2
Currently benched by me, app in which you can add, delete and update notes using firebase as your database. You should also send a notification when a new note is added. Use fragments instead of activities.
